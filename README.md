# Many Pacmen
> Week 7 Project from MIT xPro Full Stack Certificate program



## Description 
The original goal of this project was to create many pacmen using a JavaScript "factory," have them move in random directions and bounce of boundary walls.

### Original Project Goals:
- Create a single Pacman with the click of a button
- Be able to create many Pacmen by running the same function again
- Keep track of the information for each Pacman in an array of all the Pacmen
- Use array methods and DOM injection
- Have all Pacmen start moving in random directions and speeds
- All Pacmen bounce off boundary edges and keep moving

<!-- From PacMan Repo Description -->
<!-- Update the following -->
<!-- ### Refactoring:
I am attempting to make this more like a PacMan game.
- Created my own svg image file(s) in Adobe Illustrator
- Use CSS properties to rotate and reverse the images as needed
  - This allows me to use only 2 images ("open" and "closed") for movement in all 4 directions
  - The original project used 4 separate png images to move PacMan in a horizontal direction only (moving right open and closed mouth, and moving left open and closed mouth).
- Start / Stop movement by space bar and button click
- Change direction by keyboard arrows and on-screen arrows
- Added vertical movement and boundary detection
- Added a Boundary box so PacMan stays inside the box and does not move to the edges of the screen
- Boundary edge redetection on window resize -->

## To Run
This project can be viewed live at [kParsonsDesign.github.io/many-pacmen/](https://kParsonsDesign.github.io/many-pacmen/).

## Roadmap
- May have the Pacmen eat each other (either based on relative size, direction of movement, or z-index)
